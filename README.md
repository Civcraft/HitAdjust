HitAdjust
=========

Bukkit plugin to change Minecraft attacking mechanics.

For mechanics testing purposes, not actual production use,likely unbalanced with default items.


Config flags:

hitdelay- Seconds of delay between hits in ms

invincibilitylength - Length of global invincibility period in ms

knockbackmodifier - Multiplier for knockback amount

meleeEnabled - HitAdjust applies to melee attacks

bowEnabled - HitAdjust applies to bow attacks

charge - Users can 'charge' their sword by not hitting for up to 2 seconds, causing it to do extra damage (175% at default).  Used to lower the effect and necessity of fast clicking/reflexive aiming in PvP
